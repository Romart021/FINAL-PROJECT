Google Classroom is a one-stop shop for teaching and learning. Our simple and secure tool assists educators in managing, measuring, and enriching learning experiences.
One of the greatest advantages of Google Classroom is Google Docs; these documents are saved online and shared with a limitless number of people, so when you create an announcement or assignment using a Google doc, your learners can access it immediately through their Google Drive.</p> </h2>

This is demonstrated by the results, which show that students are very actively involved and participate in the learning and teaching process. Aside from that, they discussed their thoughts on the learning material at the time.
It's quick and simple. Pushing the record button and speaking can be much faster than other forms of communication. It's a fantastic creative outlet. Many platforms make it simple to add creative touches to a video.
Zoom provides free users with up to 40 minutes of meeting time, whereas Google Meet's free plan allows for up to one hour of group meetings. Meeting recordings and breakout rooms are available on all Zoom plans, but only on paid Google Meet plans. For polling, both platforms require paid subscriptions.</p> </h2>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">	<center><p>They are able to speak with their students and hold dialogues with them. They can also teach digital skills to their students, such as commenting, sharing, and spotting bogus news. These abilities will help kids prepare for maturity and potential technology-related employment.
Because Facebook is such a significant part of most people's lives, it's not unexpected that it's also a big part of students' lives. It can assist pupils in developing digital skills and creating material, as well as allowing professors to model proper use of digital technologies in the classroom and lecture hall. They can also use Facebook to educate themselves.
Students can ask questions regarding homework, coursework, school subjects, or any other issue and receive responses from classmates and friends who may have prior knowledge with the subject.
Students can ask teachers or lecturers questions and receive responses.Lecturers can construct public discussion areas using Facebook groups.
Instead of broadcasting all of these interactions on their main feed, lecturers can use groups as private forums for student debates.
Lecturers can participate in discussions by establishing live video broadcasts in which they can respond to students' questions in 4-6 phrases.</p> </h2>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">	<center><p>It makes chatting more efficient. This app links directly to Facebook's messaging system, allowing users to send and receive messages more faster than they could using a mobile browser. This is because the messaging system appears right away on a user's selected device's screen.
You need it to connect with customers, investors, potential employees, the press, and others, and if you don't have a simple, compelling message, they won't bother learning more. They will not take the time to learn about, and ultimately love and share, your product.
They save time because materials are sent via message rather than being distributed individually by the teacher. Students can be easily re-grouped; if a text proves too difficult for a student, they can easily be assigned another one, or if a student arrives late, they can easily be assigned a text.</p> </h2>
