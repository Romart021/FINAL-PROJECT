It can assist pupils in developing digital skills and creating material, as well as allowing professors to model proper use of digital technologies in the classroom and lecture hall. They can also use Facebook to educate themselves.
Students can ask questions regarding homework, coursework, school subjects, or any other issue and receive responses from classmates and friends who may have prior knowledge with the subject.

They save time because materials are sent via message rather than being distributed individually by the teacher.
